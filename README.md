# MetaCodeQuiz

## Functionality

In this program the user is prompted questions about programming.

## Where to start?

To do/Needed.

1. Inititalize values

2. function to execute code

3. make it dynamic-- maybe use .innerHTML to generate the next set of questions? Hmmm. Or what is a better way of doing it? research.

4. Timer in all pages (or the 1 page) at the top of page. How much time should they get. Per question or for the whole quiz? For the whole quiz would be easier.

5. score counter
if score = true then +1 to score. Maybe a for loop? we'll need a variable init for score
else if false "execute.this"

6. High Score will need to be an array. We're going to append and/or add to the array of high scores. Hmmm maybe we should do an empy [] to start, then use shift or another array adder to start adding scores. We're going to do the two value-pairs:

initials & scoreValue

user input on initials. We'll need a user gui input. what is relevant js. include it here. 

7. Develop at least 4 options to pick from on each question. math.floor(math.random +1)   ????? we'll need a plus 1 and make it a range of 4 options. Does that mean 0-3 so that we have 4 total indexes? hmmmm. or 1-4 doesn't really matter
